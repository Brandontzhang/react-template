# Basic React Project Template

Isn't it a pain when you have some project idea that you want to get into, but end up spending the first hour or two setting up a react project because you really don't do it that much, and things keep changing with different versions of stuff getting updated all the time?

Well... I'm tired of that. So this is the template that I've created for a basic React project. It has the following basics installed:

- Typescript
- TailwindCSS

Pretty simple right? I'll have other branches with more configurations such as redux.
